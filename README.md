I have uploaded LAB Number 3 which shows 'How we can use the Python PANDAS to pre-process our data'.
It contatins examples of methods and functions which can be used for preprocessing a dataset.
Here we have used Salaries.csv dataset.
Here we are checking how many columns, column names and total count of records in the dataframe.
In addition to this we have also checked the datatype of column 'phd' with datatype() function and changed the datatype with astype() function.
